The solution involved carefully examining how props were being passed and handled within the nested route structure. The issue was resolved by using the `useParams` hook in the `Profile` component to access the parameters from the URL:

```javascript
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function Profile() {
  let {id} = useParams(); // Extract parameters
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Profile</h1>
      <p>Profile ID: {id}</p>
      {/* ...rest of the component... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This modification ensures that the `Profile` component correctly receives and utilizes the necessary parameters from the URL, resolving the rendering issue.
